# BrainStation Data Science Capstone : Skin Segmentation
## Advanced Skin Segmentation for Enhanced Image Processing and Computer Vision Applications
=========================

### Executive Summary

The problem at hand is in the realm of Image processing and machine learning. The focus is on Skin segmentation. This experiment will help distinguish between skin and non-skin areas in images. 

### Demo
 
 TBA


### Methodology


### Organization

#### Repository 

* `data` 
    - contains link to copy of the dataset (stored in a publicly accessible cloud storage)
    - saved copy of aggregated / processed data as long as those are not too large (> 10 MB)

* `model`
    - `joblib` dump of final model(s)

* `notebooks`
    - contains all final notebooks involved in the project

* `docs`
    - contains final report, presentations which summarize the project

* `references`
    - contains papers / tutorials used in the project

* `src`
    - Contains the project source code (refactored from the notebooks)

* `.gitignore`
    - Part of Git, includes files and folders to be ignored by Git version control

* `conda.yml`
    - Conda environment specification

* `README.md`
    - Project landing page (this page)

* `LICENSE`
    - Project license
